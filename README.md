# Frontendmentor challenges

## 1. Tic Tac Toe (React)
  - View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
  - Bonus 1: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
  - Bonus 2: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in        blocking your moves and trying to win
